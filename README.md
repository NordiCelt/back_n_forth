# back_n_forth
Bash script program to copy files from home folder to another.

## Purpose
I keep all of my Github and Bitbucket Repos in a separate "github" folder on my home folder, in order to satisfy an obsessive compulsive sense of order and logic. I am aware that this may not make the most sense to some, as there must be two local copies with something like dotfiles in order to have that and have those programs do their jobs as well, but there it is.

## Action
This is really a series of Bash lines that can be typed into the Terminal one at a time, but every time I touched my files I have to copy them over before pushing them to Github/Bitbucket.I figured, instead of repitition, lets make automation.  That is what programming is all about.

## Shortcut to the Shortcut
I actually created an alias "cpa" so that I don't even have to call "back_n_forth" anymore... I made easy easier.

## Plans
I intend to extend the action of the program to add, commit, and push the files appropriately as well.
